Hello, my name is Sadman Ishtiak. And this is supposed to be my 2-2 project for my university course. In this project I have decided to make a program that will allow a user to work on his/her competetive programming jurney. This project is built using Java-21 as the base language and I have decided to make the program into a web program as this is very small program for a very specific group of users that also requires an internet connection. AS this will be only be useful for a very small group of people so making it as a web program is more useful as the program will not take up extra recourses even when not used in the user computer.

To make this program I have to learn various things in Java, and various things in web developement, backend management using spring, and various things in spring boot as well. So my learning materials will also be stred in this same repository so that I can later quickly get the gist of the work and I can also reread all the things in the documents if I ever need to.
