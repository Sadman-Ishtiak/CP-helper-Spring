I have tried my best to follow a tutorial for the last two dayy to make a login system for my project and failed extremely miserablely. 
Spring boot is actually difficult if you don't know web design theory. So I have decided to start this project with a new mindset.
I only have til new year to actually finish this project so, I will first learn to make the sites in Spring and then use basic HTML.
And then I will start working on the backend. and the last target will be to make a registration system and customizability or perks for the registered users.
